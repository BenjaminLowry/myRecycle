# myRecycle

Welcome to the repository for 'myRecycle'!

myRecycle is an non for-profit app that aims to promote sustainability through encouraging users to recycle more frequently. A system of points, levels and ranks all incentivize users to conciously remember to recycle, and also to keep a log of when they do. 

myRecycle was created by Benjamin Paul Lowry, a junior in high school in Hong Kong. He wanted to create the app to help solve Hong Kong's major waste problem.

myRecycle can be found on the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myrecycle/id1147594205?mt=8).
